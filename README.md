# ulbitv-darkmode
Custom styles for UlbiTV course.

Implemented:
- Dark mode
- Adaptation of almost the entire interface for it (except for tickets, I didnâ€™t want to send trash to Timur)
- Redesigned some elements to make it more match dark mode
- Increased video player size
- Increased max-width limits
- The "send" button in comments sections are now always visible, decreases UI distraction
- Slightly changed lesson view page layout.
- Kind of support of mobile (not really tested, because idk if it really needed?)


Installation:
- Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/) (Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/))

- Done.
